ADDITIONAL:

Some means of having ranks, with hard-coded commands, i.e:
`- Privilege, Rank Name, Colour, Priv. Flags, etc.

   Members could be given privilege (with default of X.)
   For this to be enabled, a RANK flag would need setting.
   Would give different formats for -channel.who, -channel.say, etc.
   -channel.ranks to list different ranks, and/or users and their rank.

chat <MESSAGE>  (Equivalent of '- <MESSAGE>')

-[<CHANNEL>] <MESSAGE>
-[<CHANNEL>] .<COMMAND>
-list

Allows chatting over multiple channels, which must be joined.  If <CHANNEL>
is ommitted, last chatting channel used is assumed.  If <CHANNEL> is
abbreviated, it will be matched to nearest channel name.

'-' used without a channel name refers to default channel, which is the first
chatting channel you joined since connecting, or the chatting channel you set
as your default channel using '-<CHANNEL> .default'.  When used in this form,
a space (' ') must be used between '-' and your message/command, e.g:
'- hello' to say "Hello" over default chatting channel.

-<CHANNEL> [.join]        Join chatting channel <CHANNEL> (The command '.join'
                          is optional and may be ommitted.)  If the channel
                          is private and you haven't been blocked from joining
                          it, a request to join the chatting channel will be
                          sent to its operators.
-<CHANNEL> .default       Set <CHANNEL> as your default chatting channel.  Once
                          set, you can use '-' without the channel name to
                          chat over it.  NOTE:  The first chatting channel you
                          join (After connecting to TCZ) will be automatically
                          set as your default chatting channel.
-[<CHANNEL>] .leave       Leave chatting channel <CHANNEL>.
-[<CHANNEL>] .who <PAGE>  List users on chatting channel <CHANNEL>, providing
                          it's public and accessible by you.
-list [all] <PAGE>        Lists currently active chatting channels (If 'all'
                          is specified, all available chatting channels will
                          be listed), along with number of users on the
                          channel, its subject, etc.  (NOTE:  If a chatting
                          channel has a '!' to the left of its name, you will
                          not be able to join it, unless invited.)
-<CHANNEL> .subject       Shows you the subject of <CHANNEL>.
-<CHANNEL> .operator      List all current operators of <CHANNEL>.
-<CHANNEL> .owner         Tells you who owns <CHANNEL>.

                                      <CHANNEL> (So they may join it whenever

                                      yellow text on a blue background, etc.
                                      (See section on substitutions.)  The

(All operator commands available on all channels owned by lower level chars)
-[<CHANNEL>] .owner [<NAME>]          Make <NAME> the owner of the <CHANNEL>.
                                      If <NAME> is ommitted, the current owner

-[<CHANNEL>] .permanent               Make <CHANNEL> permanent, so it will
                                      remain even when there are no users
                                      using it, or TCZ is shutdown and
                                      restarted.  If it's already permanent,
                                      it will become temporary (The default)
                                      again, and will be removed when it has
                                      no users.
