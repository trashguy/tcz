  $Id: IMPLEMENT,v 1.1.1.1 2004/12/02 17:44:29 jpboggis Exp $

Main stuff requiring implementation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  *  @dataformat/@?dateformat.
  *  @?datetime supports new formats.
  *  Command parameter prompts (prompt.c)
  *  Pagetell lists.
  *  Mail system?

  *  @import/@export.
  *  New configurable character rank names.
  *  get/drop credits + SECURE flag + documentation + @rank credit = include
       column for credit in self-owned locations, but don't include in user's
       total credit.
  *  Bug fixes (Try and get rid of some of the stuff in this file!)
  *  Name lists in page/tell and friends (Using lists.c)
  *  'friends.c' using 'lists.c' for multiple users (I.e:  'fset friends = !inform'.)
  *  Site database improvements.
  *  Hard-coded channels.
  *  Hard-coded mail system (Also using 'lists.c'.)
  *  Hard-coded feelings.
  *  Hard-coded global teleports.


Command parameter prompts:  ( X> needs setting for appropriate commands!)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  -> = Interactive prompts added.
  X> = Interactive prompts not required.

  Test '@desc' with interactive prompting.

prefs_set:
~~~~~~~~~~
Prompt for built-in command arguments:  Yes/No.
           Automatically start editor:  Yes/No.

preferences.c:  Move 'set' preference flags from flags2 to prefflags

Custom date/time formats:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   @dateformat
   @?dateformat
   @?datetime

Dates - Allow user to set format, plus add support for DMY to {@?datetime}
        -  Test with 'help cvs' page.

TIME - Warn users of daylight saving time change, plus add setting to
       automatically adjust timediff so that daylight saving time is ignored
       ('set daylight saving = off'?)

db[x].owner = Owner(x)
db[x].location = Location(x)
db[x].destination = Destination(x)

Use CVS variables (I.e:  $Date: 2004/12/02 17:44:29 $ and $Revision: 1.1.1.1 $ ) in modules.c

HTML (View) (Use), etc. links - 'set' option to turn these on/off.

New matching code gets stuck matching for area command within #4 (Something to
  do with matching for globals in same place?)

* give already done
put <OBJ> in[to] <CONTAINER>
drop <OBJ> in[to] <CONTAINER>
get <OBJ> from <CONTAINER>
take <OBJ> from <CONTAINER>

MANUAL - Generalised upto 'TCZ-based MUD Character Levels' section (Needs
         generalising in on-line help too.)

HTML:  Refererer      - Use this to reject input/output connections that
                        don't originate from already generated input/output
                        pages, parent frame or connect/create form.

@with:  @with fothers|eothers <NAME> do ...
        @with <OBJECT TYPES> database do ... = TYPE;!TYPE;TYPE
        @with <OBJECT TYPES> owned by <NAME> do ...
        @with [unique]connected do ...
        @with <OBJECT TYPES> (<FLAGS>) <OBJECT> do ...

Userlogs - Code to go through directory and remove log files from users who
           no-longer exist.  Possible to check date file was last accessed
           and only delete if over 1 month old?

@?char - Returns ID of 1 non-char then nothing.

Flags:
~~~~~~
  Character flags db[x].data->player.flags for character specific flags?
  Tertiary flags?  (For future expansion)

Admin rank names - Make these customisable, plus generic names that will always
                   work on any TCZ-based MUD, such as LEVEL1/DEITY,
                   LEVEL2/ELDER, LEVEL3/WIZARD, LEVEL4/APPRENTICE, etc.

User logs - *  Write code to go through logs and check that a character with
               the ID exists at start-up - Delete logs of characters who
               don't exist.
            *  Don't delete log files which have had activity in them in the
               past month (Last modified date of file.)
            *  When creating new character, check for existence of log file
               and delete.

@snapshot (See ideas/snapshot.txt)

FIELDS:      Allow custom fields to be attached to objects - Have name and
             value, and are owned by creator - Appear like fields actually on
             object, but can't over-ride hard-coded ones.

             @field add|remove|set|flags|owner|colour|rename|list <OBJECT> = <FIELD> [= <DESCRIPTION>]

             {@?field [flags|owner] <OBJECT> = <FIELD>}

	     Maybe {@#<FIELD> <OBJECT>} ???

             add = Add new field (Same as set)
             remove = Remove field.
	     set = Change field description (Create new field if not exist.)
	     flags = Set/reset flags on field.
             owner = Change owner.
	     colour = Set colour of field name/desc (Single code letters, as used by colourmap), e.g:  RW (Red name, White desc.)
	     rename = Rename field.
             list = List fields on object.

             Flags include:

	     P	Permanent - Can be altered but not deleted or renamed.
	     R	ReadOnly  - Can't be deleted or altered.
	     p	Private	  - Hidden and inaccessible to anyone except owner and those above level.
	     V	Visible	  - Name, description, owner and flags visible to everyone.
	     H	Hidden    - Hide field in examine (Unless owner and those above level.)
             W  Writable  - Object owner field is attached to can change its description (But not destroy it.)
             T  Transferable - Object owner can can take over ownership of field if they wish.
             I  Inheritable  - Child objects inherit field from parent (Unless they have field with same name attached.)
             E  Examine   - Appears when object is examined?
             X  Profile   - Appears on user profile (Desc substituted)?
	     L  Look      - Appears when object looked at (Desc substituted)?

             @field list MyObject

             User-defined fields:
             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	     My Field:  Wibble    {Not owner of object, visible object}
	     My Field (JC Digita):  Wibble.   {Owner of object, but not field}
             My Field [PRpVHWTEXL] (JC Digita):  Wibble.

	     Appears on 'examine'.  Cost 1 quota per 10Kb? - Keep track of how
             much they are using.

SITES:  *  Tree structure for each part of IP address ip1 -> ip2 -> ip3 -> ip4
	*  DNS lookup for DNS set records stored in IP record - Reset once
           every 24 hours - Only for exact IP's (I.e:  No wildcards used.)
	*  Connect/create/current connections stats - Update and inherit these
           up the tree of IP's to the top.
	*  Range of addresses, i.e:  172.[16-31].*.*
	*  Future support for IPv6
	*  Comments field ('@site comments') - To log reason for ban, etc.

combat.c  -  Help on Combat Areas.

SSL:  *  Port for SSL - SSL web connection automatically uses this rather than
         8080?
      *  Document SSL support in 'help ssl'.

Allow custom profile entries to be created @profile <SECTION COLOUR> =
    <NAME OF SECTION> = <SETTING>  -  Limit on number that can be created.
Profile searching command.

User log files:  Don't log if disk space is below (?)Mb (#define)

Rename do_... to sourcefile_... in source.

Place structures into separate H file instead of db.h - I.e:  structures.h

Dynamically work out number of descriptors in currently in use, rather than
   having hard-coded RESERVED_DESCRIPTORS?

@maintenance general check - Check for new char requests not owned by Admin
                             and put back into queue (This should also be
                             done on demotion of Admin to mortal/retired.)
                             request_check()?

Requests - Add limit to number of requests in the queue (MAX_REQUESTS), and
           add checks to requests code to stop request being assigned if
           there are too many (User informed, plus logged to request log,
           but no request entry created.)

           Add limit to number of requests in queue for same character name,
           and add checks to stop it being assigned if too many (Say 15).
           User informed, plus logged, but no entry created.)

'@request assign <NUMBER> = <NAME>' to assign/re-assign request to someone.

tcz --generate  -  Generate new DB should create Mortal character called
                   'maintenance' in #0 to become @admin maintenance owner,
                   so root doesn't take over ownership of destroyed objects.

CHECK NEW CONSTANTS:  YEAR, MONTH - Will affect code that uses these - values
                      should be more accurate.

'su' command for taking over identity of someone else (Similar to UNIX)

Forked database dump:  @dump restart doesn't work correctly (Says dump crashed,
                       when it didn't?)

***  Does SIGUSR1 (Database dump restart) still work with forked dump?

New 'set' option:  'set beep on|off' - When off, beep \007 code is filtered
   out when output is sent to terminal, preventing beep from pages, clock, etc.

'@logwatch' command (See '@logwatch.txt'.)

Duplicate big array:  Takes quota it would have taken to duplicate all the
                      elements, but doesn't create the elements - have to
                      use '@quota initialise' to put quota usage back to
                      normal.

                      Allow duplication of large array in cmd with (E) flag
                      set?

BBS - Allow display of 1000-9999 messages in topics, i.e:

      Topic  (100,1234)->Topic2 (1234,1234)
      Topic3  (23,123)  *Topic4    (1,23)

      On HTML, always display full counts.

ANSI - New substitution that allows backtrack through stacked ANSI-codes?
       i.e:  @echo %r%lHello %g%lGreen %?Back to red again.

Change friends code to allow more friends as user clocks up total connect time.

Use of META tags within HTML interface to prevent internet search engines
   ('robots' metatag.)

Binary tree on dynamic array index names  -  When loading from database,
   element index names would need to be added randomly to the tree to ensure
   it is reasonably balanced (I.e:  '@sort'ed dynamic array would kill
   efficiency of binary tree.)

Ability to block output from particular characters, possibly using IGNORE
   friend flag.  output() would need additional parameters to make this
   work (I.e:  Character causing output), which would result in lots of
   typing/replacement work.

Aliases  -  Sort these alphabetically when using 'aliases' to display them.

When building as someone else, attempting to set SHARABLE flag on object
   results in 'unable to set SHARABLE flag' message, but flag still gets set.

'freeze' results of vote when it closes (Possibility), so that change of
   rank doesn't cause weighted votes to change.

'.prepend' BBS command - appends to start of line rather than end.

'bbs movetopic' command (Moves subtopic to another topic.)

'bbs move' should allow moving of message with replies - perhaps it could move
   the replies too (One at a time) and then link them all up again afterwards.

Support for crediting author in help topics, and displaying when users read
   them, i.e:  %AUTHOR Fred Bloggs

ICQ section on profile.

Help on how to change gender between male/female/neuter.

BBS ignore button on HTML interface?

Ability to search log files from within TCZ.

</> wrong way round in junk? - Can junk same/higher owned objects rather than
   own and lower only.

@controller tells user that they are no-longer a puppet when used to reset
   controller of someone who isn't one.

@undelete character - don't allow character with same name as existing one to be
   undeleted.

@destroy object = permanent - on permanent object gives message 'can't destroy
   an object you own'.

Allow force of HTML output (For Pueblo MUD client) - Perhaps 'set html = on'.

Allow '@request list' in compound command.  Allow other '@request' commands
   in WIZARD / ELDER set compound commands.

Perhaps options to stop display of prefix/suffix, ()'s, etc. after name of
   character.  Perhaps separate to flags.  Possibly under 'set'.

Ability to redirect output to property/temp variable - Possibly '@redirect' - 
   i.e:  '@redirect mytemp = who' to put output of 'who' into temp variable
   mytemp.

Ability to set time on Moron flag along with logged reason - Resets the flag
   automatically after that period, or can be made indefinite (As currently.)

No []'s allowed in @name, when used on an array.

crashes if generate DB option is used, and standard directory structure
doesn't exist (crashes on shutdown, when dumping DB.)

* bbs.c:     Auto-append if message gets too long.

             BBS options for topics:

             Personal
             ~~~~~~~~
             FAVOURITE   Mark topic as favourite - enables options
                         Shows summary on login of new messages.
                         Also, 'summary favourites' (Or 'summary favorites')
                         can be used to see summary at any time.

             IGNORE      Ignore all unread messages (Makes it appear as
                         though all have been read.)

             NOTIFY      Inform of all messages added to topic.

             QUIET       No inform of new messages, even when in BBS
                         room.

             *  Above options are inherited to sub-topic if no options
                exist, or only topic access options are set.

             Topic Access
             ~~~~~~~~~~~~
             MEMBER      Makes user a member of topic.  Topic can then be
                         restricted to members only ('bbs accesslevel
                         members'.)

             BANNED      Ban user from accessing topic.

             READONLY    Read-only access to topic (No posting messages.)

             ADMIN       User can do basic topic admin, such as delete
                         same/lower messages, append, etc.

* page/tell/friends   Support for new name lookup.

* friends.c: Friend groups.

* censor.c:  Implement this, using txt/censor.txt as a guide.  For
             pre-customisable censorship DB's, create default list of
             censored words, based on those in bad_language_filter()

* sanity.c:  sanity_output() function.
	     Add options to check credit, balance, income, expenditure and
             health for negative value.

* finance.c:  'get'/'drop' work with credits (FINANCE and SECURE flags
              taken into account.)  Calls 'withdraw' or 'deposit' to do
              checks.  All usual stuff for 'get'/'drop' taken into
              account.  In addition, 'withdraw'/'deposit' can be used
              directly.  If object, they just call 'get'/'drop' which
              then calls 'withdraw'/'deposit' again.  Perhaps also
              allow 'pay' too (Matches 'here', character name, object
              name in same location.)  '.pay'/'.payed' action
              commands could be implemented, triggered when

              is used on object.  FINANCE and SECURE flags must be taken
              into account when objects are concerned.  'get'/'drop' can
              be linked up to call relevant finance commands to make things
              more realistic (Must say 'drops' instead of 'deposits' though.)
              Drop-to (And messages of location should be taken into account.

                  drop: NAME drops N credits into OBJECT.
                  take: NAME takes N credits from OBJECT.
                   pay: NAME pays N credits into OBJECT.
               deposit: NAME deposits N credits into OBJECT.
              withdraw: NAME withdraws N credits from OBJECT.

* combat.c:   Restrict @heal with negative values to WIZ set command.

              Minimum delay on @damage, to prevent abuse in loops to
              instant kill someone.  (I.e:  5 secs mimimum, unless
              WIZ flag is set.)

              Negative values with @delay require WIZ flag.

              Combat log for @delay and @damage.

              @team command - Sets team parameters for combat.

              cwho command - Shows scores for current combat area.


* sites.c:    Make format of site dump more expandable (Make similar to
              TCZ database file.)
 
* Combat stuff works?

'profiles' searching command, and perhaps web interface search form to go
with it.

 @Array [Battle System] - Banned Users Array
 Sorry, the name of a dynamic array mustn't contain the character '['.
 @array Banned Users Array
 Dynamic array Banned Users Array created with ID #34001.
 @name #34001=[Battle System] - Banned Users Array
 Banned Users Array(#34001 D)'s name set to '[Battle System] - Banned Users
 Array'.

'bbs ignore <NAME>' to ignore all posts from a particular character.  If
  UNREAD, set to being READ.

GRIPE:  (From Heathcliff(#23080) in Heathcliff's Command Workshop(#31))  How abo
ut a BBS VOTE <no> = ABSTAIN ON|OFF option, which wouldn't actually stop ppl vot
ing abstain on a message, but moreover, remove the abstain percentiles from the
final result (E.g.  ABSTAIN ON - (Votes for:  3 (33%%), Against:  3 (33%%), Abst
ain:  3 (33%%).) and ABSTAIN OFF - (Votes for:  3 (50%%), Against:  3 (50%%), Ab
stain:  3 (0%%).))  [16:49 21/09/98]
------>  Easy enough to implement.

>>>@password on CygWin32 - Doesn't seem to change password correctly.
   @newpassword seems to work.  Not important atm as CygWin32 is only used
   for development.  CygWin32 doesn't support encrypted passwords either.

DEBUG: BBS search:  Don't search in non-accessible topics.

 I think wizards/druids+ should be able to set an important post permant, so
 that in never gets automaticly destroyed, like ones containing stuff like in
 the news topic, changes to the rules or sumthin
 -trub.

Perhaps .login/.logout aliases on a character, executed at login/logout,
a bit like the similar commands.

'bbs remove =yes' for non-owned messages (as well as multiple deletes.)

.replace in editor:  If it makes text too big, don't do replace, instead give
                     error message.

Allow force of your puppet to @pay or @transfer when disconnected.

'bbs hide' command to hide messages on the BBS (From everyone bar admin and
topic owner.)

Floating point support in @?sortnumeric

Perhaps use of '!' in flags using '@list'.  Implementable?

'tell' should count as global (like page) if anyone in list of names is not
in the same room as recipient.  'friends' and 'admin' count as global.

@?replace +last - option

 Error taking over WWW connection from telnet, when user hasn't connected

(Censored Text) - Allow custom message to be set, such as (Page), (Tell).
		  Can also be set with @censor.  Don't allow use of ANSI

Allow set of puppet on any level character, but don't allow higher level to
   to be controlled by lower.

New money stuff - allow drop/get of credits, i.e:  drop 100 [= container],
get 100 [= container]:  Pay restrictions apply to 'drop' within compound
command (Except WIZARD set.)  No restrictions on 'get'.  Container must be
open to take or drop credits in it.  All drop/get rules apply to credits.
Credits should also have an appropriate mass/volume which should be taken
into account.

Problem with @breakloop all???  Jumping to wrong line number - needs checking.

*****
Summon should store location, and check to make sure it hasn't changed.  If
so, summon should be rejected automatically.

*****
Reply to friends/enemies page or tell goes to friends/enemies instead of
sender?

*****
Allow move of reply on BBS.  Reply becomes disassociated with it's original
message and other replies.

*****
Allow setting of more than 1 hardcoded feeling?  Could be implemented with
fixed size array and using ! to reset feelings.

GRIPE:  (From Sony(#8410) in The Chatting Zone BBS(#5050))  If an append
	doesn't fit on a post, is three a way that the append could be
	rejected rather than adding an incomplete apppend?  [07:24 24/06/97]
>>>>>>  Perhaps get TCZ to automatically add reply if can't append.

*****
'idle friends'???

*****
Is there any way to make it so you can type 'recall <name>'  and just get the
tells and pages from one particular person??  (Recall last page/tell from
NAME.)

'bbs read unread' - lookup code looks up and returns error message approprirate
		    for action, i.e:

		    <NUMBER>  -  Sorry, message with that number doesn't exist.
		    unread    -  Sorry, there are no unread messages...
		    next      -  Sorry, there are no more messages in this topic.

'read current' on BBS is getting corrupted by something (Possibly adding new
message in same topic.)

*** When BBS topic users list implemented, make IGNORE flag cover BBS-INFORM as
    well as summary.

Um, I have a suggestion for the @profile thing
It would be a plan or future category that tells people what you plan to do in
future years of your life.
Just thought I'd suggest that.

'bbs overview' command:  Gives overview of BBS topics and sub-topics within
			 them.

 Topic:             Subtopics:
==================================================
 Admin              Main, Voting, etc.
==================================================

For msgs:  bbs append on|off|admin  -  Default allows anyone to append to
	   message - 'off' disallows everyone, 'admin' only allows admin.

	   Default:  ON    = mortaladd topic.
		     ADMIN = non-mortaladd topic.

implement:  summary <TOPIC>[/<SUBTOPIC>] to give summary of particular
	    topic(s).

latest TOPIC/SUBTOPIC doesn't work (It does for TOPIC on it's own though.)

'readanon' on BBS should give appropriate error message when administrator
	   tries to reveal identity of other administrator who posted msg.

***  @?PAD:  Support use of ANSI codes within <PAD TEXT>?

 OK, something I've needed once or twice is a @?filterlist type command
 One where you can filter out particular items from a list

 For example
 @?extract[exact] "x" ";" "a;b;x;c;d;x;e;x;x;x"
 would return
 a;b;c;d;e

 Just an idea ;)

GRIPE:  (From Heathcliff(#23080) in Heathcliff's Command Workshop(#31))  How
	about adding an extra field to the @controller command, so that when
	you give someone a puppet you have to specify a reason (I.e.
	@controller <puppet> = <user> = Because of x y and of course z.)  [14:25 31/05/97]
