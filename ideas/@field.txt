USAGE:  @field [delete] <NUMBER>:<ARRAY> [= <NAME>]

Allows the elements of a dynamic array to be split into one or more
individually named fields, allowing you to create your own custom data
structures (Or 'records'.)  If the elements are split up into more than
one field, the cost (In Building Quota) of each element will be the number
of fields per element, e.g:  If you have two fields, each element will cost
you 2 Building Quota instead of 1.

<NUMBER> is the field number (Mortals may have upto 50 fields per dynamic
array) to set the name of (Or change the name of, if the field already exists.)
<NAME> is the name to give the field, which must not exceed 25 characters in
length and may only consist of alphanumeric text ('a'-'z', 'A'-'Z', '0'-'9'),
'-' and '_'.  If <NAME> is omitted, the field will be unnamed, and you will
only be able to reference it by its number.

If the parameter 'delete' is specified, the field will be removed from
the ENTIRE dynamic array (Resulting in the loss of any data stored in
that field of the dynamic array's elements.)

A dynamic array with fields is referenced as follows:
<ARRAY>[<ELEMENT>].<FIELD>, where <ARRAY> is the name (Or #ID) of the dynamic
array, <ELEMENT> is the element number/index name (Or a range of elements) and
<FIELD> is the field name or number, e.g:  '@desc myarray[1].myfield = Some
text', '@echo $(myarray[1].myfield)', '@echo $(myarray[1].1)', etc.  If <FIELD>
is not specified, the first field of the dynamic array will be assumed.
