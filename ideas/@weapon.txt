Prototype for hardcoded weapons:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
combat;fight   Participate in combat system ([COMBAT:  <NAME> has joined the
               battle.])  -  Cannot surrender until you have been participating
               for 10 minutes.
surrender      Surrender and leave the combat system ([COMBAT:  <NAME> has
               surrendered and left the battle.])  -  Cannot participate in
               combat system again for 10 minutes.

attributes <OBJECT> [= actual]
	Displays attributes of character (Battles won, lost, experiences,
	etc.), weapon (Actions, damage, etc.), armour (Ammo type, quantity,
        etc.), shield (Protective qualities, etc.)

        With shields, attributes displayed are based on Durability percentage
        -  If 'actual' is displayed, the actual parameters are shown, rather
        than current effective (Note about this in the help for attibutes.)

@weapon <NAME> [= <DESCRIPTION>]
	E.g:  @weapon Shotgun

@ammunition <NAME> [= <DESCRIPTION>]
	E.g:  @ammunition Box of shells

@shield <NAME> [= <DESCRIPTION>]
        E.g:  @shield Large leather shield
              @shield Bullet-proof vest

@item <NAME> [= <DESCRIPTION>]
	E.g:  @item Health Power-Up

@action <WEAPON> = [!]<ACTION> [[!]<ACTION>] [...]
        E.g:  @action shotgun = shoot fire
              Shooting actions for Shotgun(#123 W):  shoot, fire.

@modify <OBJECT> = [<TYPE>] <PARAM> <VALUE>
	E.g:  @modify shotgun = shoot accuracy 25
	      @modify ammo = expiry destroy
              @modify shield = head damage 10%

@reset <OBJECT>
	Resets delay timer on given weapon (Or if used on character, resets
        their stun time.)

@zone <WEAPON> = <LOCATION>
	Set area where weapon may be used (Usage outside this area will fail.)

.attacked	Compound command executed when non-connected Puppet or Being
                is attacked with a weapon, allowing character to fight back
                of their own accord (Would be used in adventures for monsters,
                etc.)  $1 = Attacker ID, $2 = Weapon ID.

Some Armour(#12121 S)    (Shield:  @shield)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Protection:  Repel:  Damage:  Stun:
      Head:  0%      0%       0%
      Arms:  0%      15%      5%
     Hands:  0%      0%       0%

      Legs:  0%      0%       0%
      Feet:  0%      0%       0%

Durability:  100.0%  (As this goes down, protection offered by shield also
                     reduces  -  Once it hits zero, shield is useless and
                     will either self-destroy or be re-used  -  Durability
                     reduces by 1 for every hit the shield protects against.)

Maximum durability:  10
Current durability:  10
     Expiry action:  destroy|re-use

(Repel:  Makes attacks on body part more likely to fail (Accuracy))
(Damage:  Reduces damage caused by successful hit to body part.)
(Critical:  For reference only  -  Tells you which body parts are the most
            critical to receive a hit on  -  Damage inflicted by weapons is
            increased by this percentage, then reduced by highest Damage
            percentage of any shields carried by user.)


A Power-Up Item(#1234 I)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Power-up items are used to create objects which when picked up will increase
or even decrease an attribute (Or several attributes) of a character.  The
object is either destroyed, or sent to its home.  Power-ups should be carefully
setup so that they cannot be used to cheat with.  They should be hard to find,
placed randomly and destroyed or teleported out of the combat area
(for relocation) on usage.  They should also be kept out of the combat area
for a given amount of time to prevent repetitive use.

Location:  My Area(#43221)
Zone (Usage area):  The Combat Zone(#1234)

               Increase:  Maximum:   {MAX FOR MORTALS}
Hand-to-hand:  +0.0%      100.0%     {0.5}
    Throwing:  +0.0%      100.0%     {0.5}
    Shooting:  +0.0%      100.0%     {0.5}
      Health:  +0.0%      100.0%     {100%}
       Score:  +0         N/A        {0}
        Stun:  +0s        N/A        {60s}

        Delay:  5 minutes.  {Minimum delay for items (Deity+ can set to less)}
Expiry action:  destroy|re-use

(Increase:  Increase item gives to each attribute.)
(Maximum:  Maximum value item will allow increase to (Admin can set >100%))
(Delay:  Usage delay - Should be set to high value to prevent repetitive use.)
(Stun:  This is only decreased/increased if characters health is > 0%  -  0%
        indicates character is 'dead', with stun being used to time death
        time.)

OTHER NOTES:  Weapons in #4 can be used by anyone in any combat location, e.g:
              fists (I.e:  'hit <NAME> with fists')

              Can't fight or be fought for two minutes after being killed.

              Can only fight in rooms which aren't set HAVEN.

              Can only fight and be attacked if your COMBAT flag is set and
              you are not in a public area.

              Can only hold a maximum of two hand-to-hand/shootable weapons  -
              No limit on throwable (Except mass you can hold.)

              Weapons can only be used if held, in the same room or located in
              #4.

              After being killed, you remain 'dead' (With 0% health) for 2
              minutes.

              Expiry action always set to 'destroy' by default for inherited
              weapon that's @duplicated.

              Weapons/ammo/shields can inherit all of their attributes:
			@parent <WEAPON> = <OBJECT>
			@modify <WEAPON> = inherit
                        @action <WEAPON> = inherit (For weapons)

			Alternatively, individual attributes may be inherited
                        by giving 'inherit' for <VALUE>.
