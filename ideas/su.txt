USAGE:  su <NAME>

'su' allows you to assume the identity of another user, providing you
know their password.  It can also be used to assume the identity of
a puppet without needing to enter their password, providing you are
their controller.

To do this, simply type 'su' followed by the name of the user.  You
will then be prompted to enter the user's password (Unless the user
is your puppet.)

If successful, your prompt will change to the name of the user, and all
commands will be executed under their identity.

You can execute commands as yourself (Rather than the 'su'ed user) by
using '.x' or '.execute'.  For example, this allows you to reply to pages/tells as yourself rather than the 'su'ed user.

When you have finished, you can stop 'su' by typing '.exit'.  This will
return you to your normal identity.

Unless the user is your puppet, all 'su' activity (Including all
commands executed under the identity of the 'su'ed user) are logged
to the 'SU' log file.  Commands executed under your own identity
(Using '.x') are not logged.

'su' can't be used from within a compound command.


NOTES:  *  Can't be used from within a compound command.
        *  Can't be used when within a 'su'.
	*  Can't be used by disconnected user (I.e:  '@force'.)
        *  Can't be used on a user who is currently connected.
        *  Can't be used on self.
	*  Log failed 'su' attempts in 'Password' and 'SU' log.
        *  Test if user is a puppet and controlled by user - If so, no
           password is required.
	*  When running a command, it temporarily changes your ID to
           that of the 'su'ed user and then executes the command.
        *  Log start/end of 'su' in 'SU' and 'Admin' log files.
        *  Commands executed under 'su' logged to 'SU' log file (Except
           those executed under own identity with '.x'.)
        *  Change prompt to name of SU'd user 
        *  Don't log stuff if user is a puppet and controlled by user
           doing 'su'.
        *  Add '(SU)' to end of name in room contents.
           I.e:  JC Digita (SU)
        *  Add '[SU: Name]' to end of user's name in 'fullname()'.
           I.e:  Test [SU: JC Digita]
