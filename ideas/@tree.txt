USAGE:  @tree <OBJECT> [= [<NESTING>] [[!]<OBJ TYPE>] [[!]<OBJ TYPE>] [...]]

<OBJECT>    Object to display tree of.
<NESTING>   Optional maximum nesting level (I.e:  '3' will only display objects
            nested up to 3 levels deep.)
<OBJ TYPE>  Optional additional object types to list (Or object types to
            exclude, if preceeded by '!'.)  Rooms and things are listed
            by default (Use '!rooms' and/or '!things' to exclude.)

            Can be:  alarms, all (List all object types), arrays, characters,
                     commands, exits, fuses, players (Same as characters),
                     properties, rooms, things, variables.


Rooms and things always listed by default (Use !rooms and !things to exclude.)

KEY:  +       Indicates object is inherited from another object.
      !       Indicates object owned by another character.
      *       Indicates connected character.
      `- (+)  Indicates further nested objects, which cannot be displayed due
              to maximum nesting level being reached (Or maximum possible
              nesting level, based on your screen width.)  To see the missing
              part of the object tree, you will need to use '@tree' on the
              object the '`- (+)' is attached to.

Example usages:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
@tree <OBJECT> = commands characters  (Lists compound commands and characters
                                      in tree as well as rooms/things)
@tree <OBJECT> = all                  (Lists everything in tree)
@tree <OBJECT> = all !exits           (Lists everything except exits in
                                      tree.)
