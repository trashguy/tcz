@set name = [!]being


.beingsettings dynamic array...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[move_probability]     Probability that being will move.
[command_probability]  Probability that being will execute a command at random
                       from those defined in array.
[leave_command]        Executed before being moves (Optional.)
[enter_command]        Executed after being has moved (Optional.)
[command_count]        Number of defined commands.
[command<N>]           Defined command (<N> starts at 0.)


Being events take place every 10 seconds, with .beingsettings[move_probability]
and .beingsettings[command_probability] determine whether being moves or
executes a command (Picked at random from a pre-defined list.)  If being should
both move and execute command in one go, command will be executed first.

When being moves, it will go through an exit at random  -  If exit is locked
against it, it will choose next exit and so on until it finds one it can go
through.  If it can't find an exit it can go through in the current room, or
there are no exits, it will return to its home location.

As with puppets, beings appear in the contents lists of rooms.


$8    On executing command, $8 holds the #ID/name of a connected character,
      puppet or being (Not self) picked at random in the current room.


Example:
~~~~~~~~
@character Fred = wibble
@set *fred = being

Example .beingsettings (For Fred)...

[move_probability]     10
[command_probability]  25
[command_count]        3
[command0]             :waves to {@?name $8}.
[command1]             wibble at {@?name $8}.
[command2]             :mutters something to {@?name $8}.
