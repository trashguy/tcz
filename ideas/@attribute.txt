@attribute [<OBJECT> =] [<PAGE NO>] [<GROUP>]
	If <GROUP> is not specified, lists all attribute groups that are
        currently set on yourself.  If <GROUP> is specified, attributes within
        that group that are currently set on yourself are listed.  If <OBJECT>
        is specified, attributes set on <OBJECT> will be listed instead of
        attributes set on yourself.

@attribute create <GROUP>[.<NAME>] [...]
	Creates new attribute with the name <NAME> within the attribute group
	<GROUP>, or creates new attribute group with the name <GROUP> (If
        <NAME> is not specified.)  Each attribute group costs 10 Building
        Quota to build, and upto 31 attributes may be definited for each
        attribute group (+ 1 default modify attribute.)  Multiple attributes/
        attribute groups can be created in one go, by specifying more than one
        <GROUP>[.<NAME>], i.e:  '@attribute mygroup.member mygroup.admin
        mygroup.banned'.  Attribute names may only consist of letters ('a'-'z',
        'A'-'Z'), digits ('0'-'9'), '-' or '_', and may be up to 20 characters
        in length.  Each attribute group has a reserved attribute 'modify',
        which when set on a character will allow them to set/reset any
        attribute within the attribute group on any object in the database.

	* TECHNICAL *   Attribute groups stored in similar structure to
		        the database.  (long) ID for attribute group, (long)
                        for attribute flags (31 attributes + 1 for modify
                        attribute.)  Binary tree maintained on entire
                        attribute group structure.

                        Attributes set on characters maintained in linked
                        list attached to user (12 bytes = 1 long for group
                        ID, 1 long for attributes set, 1 long for next ptr.)
                        For extra efficiency, attribute entry is moved to
                        front of list each time its used (So if used again
                        straight after (More than likely), less searching is
                        needed.)

@attribute [list|groups] [<PAGE NO>] [<GROUP>[.<NAME>]] [= <OWNER>]
	If <GROUP> is specified, but <NAME> is not, attributes within the
        attribute group <GROUP> will be listed.  If <NAME> is also specified
        (Which may contain wildcards), attributes within the attribute group
        <GROUP> matching <NAME> will be listed.  If <GROUP> contains wildcards,
        attribute groups matching <GROUP> which you own will be listed.

        If 'groups' is given instead of 'list', groups will be listed, rather
        than attributes within a given attribute group.

        Admin:  <OWNER> lists attribute groups owned by another character.
		'all' can be specified to list all attribute groups in the
		entire database.


@attribute destroy [group] <GROUP>[.<NAME>] [<GROUP>[.<NAME>]] [...] [= yes]
	Destroys specified attributes, or if 'group' is specified, and <NAME>
        isn't, destroys an entire attribute group (For confirmation, the
        second parameter ('yes') must be specified too.

@attribute set [<GROUP>[.<NAME>]] [...] = [!]<FLAG> [[!]<FLAG>] [...]
	Sets/resets attribute flags on attribute groups or individual
        attributes.  The attribute flags are listed lower down, and have
        the detailed effect when set on an attribute...

@attribute object <NAME> [= <GROUP>[.<NAME>] [<GROUP>[.<NAME>]] [...]]
	Creates an attribute object, and initially gives it the specified
        attributes (If specified.)  An attribute object is an object type
        which serves no purpose other than for setting attributes on.  It
        has no description, etc.

@set <OBJECT> = [!]^<GROUP>[.<NAME>] [[!]^<GROUP>[.<NAME>]] [...]
	Sets/resets specified attributes on <OBJECT>.  If <NAME> is ommited,
        all attributes within the attribute group <GROUP> with the GROUP
        attribute flag will be set/reset on the object.

        @set *wibble = ^stupidclub.member
	StupidClub.member attribute set on Wibble(#12345 Pay).

{@?set <OBJECT> = [!]^<GROUP>[.<NAME>] [[!]^<GROUP>[.<NAME>]] [...]}
	Queries whether particular attributes or attribute groups are set
        on <OBJECT>.  If <NAME> is ommited, queries whether any attributes
        within <GROUP> are set on <OBJECT>

        E.g:  @if {@?set me = ^stupidclub.member} do @echo You are a member of
                  the stupid club!

{@?attributes <OBJECT> [= <COUNT>]}
	Returns #ID of first (Or <COUNT>) attribute object attached to
	<OBJECT>.

{@?attrid <GROUP>[.<NAME>]}
	Returns ID of specified attribute group or the attribute <NAME>
        of attribute group <GROUP>.  Can also be used to see if an attribute
        group/attribute within an attribute group exists, as '*NOTHING*' is
        returned if attribute group/attribute doesn't exist.

	E.g:  @echo {@?attrid stupidclub.member}
        2.1

{@?attrname <GROUP>[.<NAME>]}
	Same as above, execept full attribute group/attribute name is returned
	instead of ID number.

	E.g:  @echo {@?attrname 2.1}
        StupidClub.member

@find/@list	[!]^<GROUP>[.<NAME>] can be used to restrict objects listed to
                those with specified attributes set/not set.  Only one
                attribute group to include/exclude may be specified, but as
                many attributes from the group may be specified as you like.

                @list characters = ^stupidclub.member

Locks		Objects can be @locked to attributes, e.g:

		@lock Entrance to club = ^stupidclub.member&!^stupidclub.banned

BBS		Access to topics can be restricted to users with a particular
                attribute, e.g:  bbs attribute access ^stupidclub.member

                bbs attribute access	Allows access to topic.
                bbs attribute add	Allows adding/replying to messages.
                bbs attribute append    Allows appending to messages.
		bbs attribute banned    Bans from topic (Similar to BBS flag.)
                bbs attribute delete    Allows deletion of non-owned messages.
                bbs attribute owner	Gives all privileges that topic owner
					has, with the exception of deleting
					the topic itself ('removetopic'.)

Each new attribute group is given the attribute flags COMMAND, GROUP.

(C)	COMMAND       (Default)  Allows attribute to be set/reset from within
                      a compound command.

(D)     DISCONNECT    If an attribute has this attribute flag set and is set on
                      a character, the attribute will be reset when they next
                      disconnect.  Also, when The Chatting Zone is shutdown
                      and restarted, attributes with this attribute flag set
                      will be reset on all characters in the database.

(G)     GROUP         (Default)  If the entire attribute group is set/reset on
                      an object (Using '@attribute set <OBJECT> = [!]<GROUP>'),
                      only attributes which have this attribute flag set will
                      be set/reset on the object.

(I)	INHERIT       (Default)  Attribute will inherit all flags which are set
                      on the attribute group.  By default, all new attributes
                      have this flag set, so for example, you can give the
                      USERRESET attribute flag to every attribute within an
                      attribute group by typing '@attribute mode <GROUP> =
                      userset'.  To prevent an attribute from inheriting
                      attribute flags from the attribute group, simply reset
                      its INHERIT attribute flag.  Inherited attribute flags
                      are shown in lowercase in the 'Flags:' field of the
                      '@attribute list' command.

(M)	MONTHLYRESET  Attribute will be reset on all objects in the database
                      on a monthly basis (Every 28 days.)

(O)	OWNCOMMAND   Allows attribute to only be set/reset from within a
                     compound command which you own (This attribute flag
                     overrides the COMMAND attribute flag.)

(R)	USERRESET    Allows any character to reset the attribute flag on
                     themselves or any of their objects.

(S)	USERSET      Allows any character to set the attribute flag on
                     themselves or any of their objects.

(T)	INITIALISE   Attribute will be reset on all objects in the database
		     when The Chatting Zone is next shutdown and restarted.

(W)	WEEKLYRESET  Attribute will be reset on all objects in the database
                     on a weekly basis (Every 7 days.)

        [???]        Flag used to mark whether attribute has been destroyed and
                     recreated during database dump.
