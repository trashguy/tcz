Character Flags
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Implement db[x].data->player.flags as integer.

Stores character only flags (Move existing character only flags from
db[x].flags & db[x].flags2 to db[x].data->player.flags)

Add ability to search on these to @find/@list.

Split 'help flags' into sections for object flags, character flags and
both.


New character flags:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
OffDuty    Allows Admin to go off duty, making them appear as 'Offduty'
           rather than respective Admin rank in various lists.

           Only effective on user command-line, so it shouldn't affect
           Compound Commands written by user that need Admin
           privileges.

           Doesn't remove Admin read/write privs, but prevents use of
           certain Admin commands, such as Welcome/Assist, etc. 

           Stops welcome/assist prompts and 'page admin', but still
           allows '@nat'.

Quell      Gives Admin/Assistant/Experienced Mortal Builder privileges
           (Ideal for testing.)

ReadOff    Temporarily removes ability to read everything of same/lower
           level for Admin/XB (Can be set by user themselves.)  Also,
           removes read privs picked up by friend flags.

WriteOff   Temporarily removes ability to write to everything below
           level for Admin (Can be set by user themselves.)  Also,
           removes write privs picked up by friend flags.
 
PreSuffix  When on (Default), shows prefix/suffix on user names, when
           off, these are removed.

Nat        When on (Default), Admin user gets '@nat' messages - can
           use '@nat on|off' to switch on/off.  Admin user should get
           this when promoted automatically and lose it if demoted.

Beep       For 'set beep on|off'.
