Right. Ok. Hmmm, this is a complete begginers guide to the Chatting
Zone (TCZ). I wrote it 'cos I thought other people might like a
kickstart, oh yeah, and to get more women.

What is The Chatting Zone ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It's a Virtual World. Simple as that.
When you're connected you can talk to other users (this is what
most people use it for) but this takes place in rooms and places.
Also wEiRd things happen. We have a fully working bus service
where you can get on and off to take you to other rooms and
places!! Also you can get building points which let you build
your own rooms. You also get objects which you can pick up and
mess around with. You can attack each other and do most 'normal'
stuff you could do in the rEaL world. Cool huh ? We like to
think so...

Loggin In
~~~~~~~~~
Right to start off you'll need Telnet access. Once you've got
this you need to telnet to this number:
141.163.11.1 8342
The last number (8342) is a port number. Do NOT put a dot between
141.163.11.1 and 8342 OK ? Good.
Right you should get a nice title screen.

Creating a New Account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After you have logged in you'll want to create a new account. To do
this you'll need to type:
create [newuser] [password]
for example to create the user 'Fluffy' with the password 'Sheep'
you'll need to type:
create Fluffy Sheep
That's it your now connected !!! Simple eh ???

To connect to your account at a later date simply type:
connect [user] [password]
for example to re-connect to your Fluffy account you would type:
connect Fluffy Sheep
Dead simple. Even I can manage it !

Starting Out
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before you set off, you'll need a description, a sex, and a race.
To do this you'l need to use some quite cunning commands...

1)  Give yourself a description by typing '@desc me = <DESCRIPTION>'.
2)  Give yourself a race by typing '@race me = <RACE>'.
3)  Give yourself a gender by typing '@set me = male' or '@set me = female'.

Also for on line help just type 'help' (duhh)

Talking Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The talking commands are VERY simple.

"<MESSAGE>  Makes you say "<MESSAGE>" to everyone in the same room as you.
:<MESSAGE>  Shows your name, with <MESSAGE> after it. Used for actions.

e.g. If I was Fluffy and I typed:
"Hello !!!
Fluffy would say 'Hello' to everyone in the room.
If Fluffy typed:
:scratches his nose
Every one would see 'Fluffy scratches his nose'
and if Fluffy typed:

The other rather useful command is called 'page'. Paging someone will
send them a message from wherever you are to whever they are...
So if Fluffy wanted to page Harlequin he would type
page Harlequin = Hello Harlequin, my sister fancies you...
And finally, the whisper command
To whisper something to someone (they have to be in the same room)
type the following (for example)
whisper Harlequin = My sister wants your phone number...

Going to other Rooms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To go to another room simply type its name. The silly room is where
most of the talking goes on so to go to it just type
silly

Other Useful Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
look - shows you who and what is the room with you
who - shows you who is on TCZ
enter [room] - enter another room
whereis *[person name] - tells you where someone is (and yes, you do
  need the * in front of their name...
QUIT - leave TCZ (must be in CAPITALS)
take - take an object
read - read something
examine - examine an object
give - give someone an object
open - opens something
wrap [number] - sets your wordwrap (like in a word processor) to
  whatever number you specify...
yell - yells something

Well, ermm, that's it
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Thats the basic stuff over with. The help command gives you help on
all sorts a things so you can learn the advanced stuff from that...
Anyway, I hope to see you on TCZ !!!

If you want any help [or a date] mail me at....
vaughan@sc.plym.ac.uk
or catch me on TCZ as Harlequin.
Also you can mail Elder Wizard Whoosh on
A.McLean@argus.plym.ac.uk

OK ? Good...

Byeee....
