Combat Notes:


League table holds current rank and updates in real time as score of user goes
up/down.

If lives are limited, score is doubled for character who takes last life of
another.

USAGE:  @league [<ROOM> =] [on|off|reset] [<NAME>] [= <REASON>]

Enables or disables the league table within a room.  When enabled, the room
becomes a combat zone, where users can engage in combat.  <ROOM> optionally
specifies the room, otherwise your current location is assumed.

Once enabled, the owner of the room has full use of the combat building
commands, enabling them to build a combat system complete with the commands,
weapons, etc. neccessary for users to battle each other.

Combat attributes such as health, health, score, battles won/lost, etc. are
local to each combat area.

The league table can be enabled by Wizards/Druids and above, but can only
be disabled by Elder Wizards/Druids and above (This deletes the league table.)

To disable the league table, a <REASON> must be given.

The 'reset' option resets the attributes of a user in the league table, which
can be done by the combat area owner, and Wizards/Druids and above.  The <NAME>
of the user must be specified, e.g:  '@league reset Fred Bloggs'


Combat Commands:


USAGE:  @combat time [<ROOM> =] <TIME>

Sets time limit for combat (Only really useful if scoring mode is 'hiscore'.)
Time limit begins when first user enters and engages in combat.


USAGE:  @combat start [<ROOM> =] [<TIME>]

Sets (Or resets if <TIME> is omitted) a start time on battles.  When first
user joins the battle, other users only have this time in which to join the
battle before fighting starts.

Ideal for tournament combat mode, where users cannot join the battle once
it has started.


USAGE:  @combat score [<ROOM> =] [accumulative|hiscore]

Sets scoring mode in league table:

accumulative   Points you gain or lose in battle are added to or taken away
               from your league table score.  (DEFAULT)

hiscore	       Your final score is recorded in the league table if it beats
               your previous score.

.  Accumulative increases/decreases score within league table
as battles are won/lost.  'hiscore' starts score at zero when user begins
combat.  On leaving, losing last life or time limit being reached, score is
updated if it beats current hiscore in league table.



USAGE:  @combat battles [<ROOM> =] [accumulative|incremented]

Controls updating of battles won/lost in league table:

accumulative   If you win a battle, battles won are incremented by 1 in the
               league table, otherwise battles lost are incremented.

               In order to win, you must remain in the battle until all
               other opponents are dead, or time limit is reached (Must be
               1st.)

               This option works best with a time limit set on battles or
               limited lives.  Also works best with 'match' or 'tornament'
               battle mode.

incremented    Battles won/lost are incremented each time you kill a victim or
               someone kills you.  (DEFAULT)


USAGE:  @combat mode [<ROOM> =] [normal|match|tournament]


Controls battle mode, which affects joining and leaving:

normal       Users can join and leave battle as they wish.  They can also
             rejoin if they lose all their lives.  Not recommended if
             accumulative battles option is being used.

match	     Users can join battle, and can leave if they wish, but they
             cannot rejoin if they lose all of their lives (They can
             rejoin when battle is over.)  Limited lives and/or battle time
             limit is recommended with this option.

tournament   Users cannot join battle in progress.  Those wishing to
             participate must join prior to battle starting (Setting a start
             time with '@combat start' is recommended.)  Users can leave the
             battle if they wish, but cannot rejoin until it has finished.

             The battle continues until only one user remains alive or time
             limit is reached.  Limited lives and/or time limit on battle is
             recommended with this option.


USAGE:  @combat lives [<ROOM> =] [<LIVES>]

Sets (Or resets if <LIVES> is omitted) limited lives.


USAGE:  @combat notify [<ROOM> =] on|off

        You hit <VICTIM>, reducing %p health to NNN%.  (DAMAGE)
        You have killed <VICTIM>.                      (KILL)

kill    Notifies when users kill each other:

	[<NAME> has killed <NAME>.]

        Your health increases to 100%.
        Your health decreases to 10%.

delay   Generate default delay messages ('@delay'):

        You cannot fight for another <TIME>.

update	Gives status update every minute, plus extra update at 30, 15, 10, 5
        and 0 seconds remaining time if time limit is in place:

        [1st, Score: 250, Won: 3, Lost: 1, Health: 100%, Lives: 9, Time: 10m.]

final   Gives final message when you leave combat, lose your last life or time
        runs out (This is followed by status update if enabled):

        You surrender and leave the battle.
        You have no lives remaining and have lost the battle.
        [TIME IS UP!  The battle is over.]


NOTE:  'kill' is not shown to users in the same room as the victim.


USAGE:  @combat join|leave [<ROOM> =] <NAME>

Enables user to take part in combat or leave it (Without leaving combat area.)

team, which will be used within the 'rank' and 'teams' commands.
