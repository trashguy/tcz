USAGE:  @logwatch <LOGFILE> = [!]<KEYWORD> [[!]<KEYWORD>] [...]
        @logwatch <LOGFILE> = [red|green|blue|yellow|cyan|magenta|white]
        @logwatch <LOGFILE> = [on|off|beep]
        @logwatch <LOGFILE> = [any|all]
        @logwatch <PAGE NO>

'@logwatch' is used to watch log files for specific keywords, or simply to
watch all entries logged to specific log files.

'@logwatch' without any parameters will list all of the log files that you
are currently watching, along with any keywords that are being watched for.

On/off switches watching on or off.

Beep causes terminal to beep when log entry is displayed (Useful for important
entries being watched out for.

Colours cause log to be displayed in that colour rather than default of white.

Specific keywords can be watched for by specifying <KEYWORD> (Upto 5 per log
file), and removed by preceeding with '!'.  If keywords are specified, only
log file entries which contain any of those keywords will be displayed.  If
'@logwatch <LOG FILE> = all' is specified, only entries containing ALL of the
keywords will be displayed.

Implementation:  Add extra fields to character data to hold log file number,
                 matched keywords, etc.  Will need DB sanity check to ensure
                 log file number still exists.  Not available to Mortals.
                 writelog() searches through connected characters who have
                 log watch entries to see if it has an entry.

                 Works by testing entries going through writelog(), testing
                 for match against connected Admin characters with logs
                 being watched.

                 When match is found, entry is displayed with match(es)
                 hi-lighted in different colour and preferably with background
                 hi-light.
