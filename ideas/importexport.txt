New TCZ Export/Import Prototype (01/06/2000)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
USAGE:  @export <OBJECTS> [= <FILENAME>]

Exports one or more objects in a portable format (ASCII text file), which can be imported
into any TCZ-based MUD.

Before using '@export', you will need to use a Telnet/MUD client which supports recording
output.  Alternatively, if you use the World Wide Web Interface, you will be presented with
a link that will directly download the resulting text-file to your computer when you click
on it.

Deities and the Supreme Being can specify a <FILENAME>, which will write the exported file
to 'export/filename.tcz' on the server machine which TCZ is running on.


<OBJECTS> specified what to export, which can be one or more of the following:

#ID              A single object with the specified #ID.
#ID+             As above, but also including all objects located within #ID.
#ID++            As above, but also including all objects which #ID and objects within
                 link to (For example, '@csucc'/'@cfail' links of compound commands.)
#ID1-#ID2[+][+]  Range of objects between #ID1 and #ID2 (Inclusive)  -  '+' or '++' can
                 be used to include objects located within objects in the range specified
                 (As detailed above.)
<TYPE>           Include objects of the specified type only ('all' for all object types.)
*<NAME>          All objects owned by the character <NAME>.

Any of the above can be EXCLUDED by prefixing with '!', e.g:  !#ID to exclude an the object
#ID, !<TYPE> to exclude an object of type <TYPE>, etc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

USAGE:  @import <OBJECTS> [= <DEFAULT OWNER> [= <FILENAME>]]

Imports objects from a file generated using '@export'.

If you are using the World Wide Web Interface, you will be given a file selection box to
choose the text file from which you wish to import (From your own computer.)  Otherwise,
you will be placed in an interactive mode into which you will need to cut and paste the
contents of the file (Once finished, type '.exit' to exit this mode), e.g:


TCZ> @import all = me

Import ready to receive new objects.  Please cut and paste a file generated using '@export'
now or type '.abort' to abort.  Once you have finished pasting the file, type '.exit'.

<OBJECTS> specified what to import, which can be one or more of the following:

#ID              A single object with the specified #ID.
#ID+             As above, but also including all objects located within #ID.
#ID++            As above, but also including all objects which #ID and objects within
                 link to (For example, '@csucc'/'@cfail' links of compound commands.)
#ID1-#ID2[+][+]  Range of objects between #ID1 and #ID2 (Inclusive)  -  '+' or '++' can
                 be used to include objects located within objects in the range specified
                 (As detailed above.)
<TYPE>           Include objects of the specified type only ('all' for all object types.)
*<NAME>          All objects owned by the character <NAME>.
ALL              All objects.

Any of the above can be EXCLUDED by prefixing with '!', e.g:  !#ID to exclude an the object
#ID, !<TYPE> to exclude an object of type <TYPE>, etc.

<DEFAULT OWNER> is the name of a character who will take over ownership of any imported objects for which the original owner cannot be set (I.e:  They do not exist or you do not have permission to write to them/their objects.)  Unless you are a Wizard/Druid or above,
this will in most cases be 'me'.  If <DEFAULT OWNER> is not specified, 'me' is assumed.

Where possible, the original #ID numbers of imported objects will be used, providing they are still available.  Otherwise, a new unused #ID will be assigned.


Database Import Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DBOwner         Change ownership of ALL imported objects to <DEFAULT OWNER>.
DBNew           Assign new #ID numbers to ALL imported objects (Do not try to use original
                #ID, even if it is available.)
DBOverwrite     Imported objects will overwrite existing objects owned by <DEFAULT OWNER>
                (Useful for backup/restore of own objects or off-line editing.)
DBNoOverwrite   Imported objects with same #ID as an existing object in the database will
                not be imported.
DBExpand        Allow database expansion to accommodate new objects with #ID higher than
                current size of database (Elder+ only.)
DBOverwriteAll  Imported objects will overwrite existing objects with same #ID, regardless
                of owner (Deity+ only.)
DBOriginal      Import objects maintaining original #ID numbers, even if this means
                overwriting an existing object or expanding the database (Deity+ only.)


Export File Format:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
; = Comments for development purpose only - Wouldn't be included in file.

NOTE:  < used within the text of a field MUST be protected with \, e.g: 
           <NAME>\<Example></NAME>

       \\ must be used for a \, e.g:  <NAME>This is a backslash: \\</NAME>

       Indentation is automatically used to make file more readable, but is not
       neccessary.  Text within fields MUST NOT be indented, for example when
       it is multiple lines of text.)

Import steps:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(1)     Read source text file.
(2)     Create objects and set basic fields (If imported objects are nested, place within
        each other in correct lists.)
(3)     Set object owners.
(4)     Try to link/place in correct locations (If not nested.)
