Modify output() to allow different classes of output.

output(descriptor,player,originator,0,1,0,class,"Text");

ORGINATOR:  Character who created output - Will be used alongside new friend
            flag that will allow selective blocking of all output from a
            particular user.  Doesn't need to be specified in all uses of
            output().

CLASS:  One or more of:

OP_AREA		Area activity (@areawrite, yell, etc.)
OP_BROADCAST	Broadcast messages (Shout)
OP_CHANNEL	Channel communication (Friends, Chat, etc.)
OP_CONNECTION	Connection information (I.e:  [NAME has connected.])
OP_COMMAND	Output from executed command.
OP_ERROR	Error messages from executed commands.
OP_EXPAND	Expanded execution of a command.
OP_EXEC		Execution of a command (Before expansion.)
OP_LOCAL	Local user activity (In same room, i.e:  Speech, movement)
OP_PROMPT	'TCZ>' prompt (Along with typed command line on WWW interface.)
OP_REMOTE	Remote user activity (Page, Tell, @notify, etc.)
OP_RESULT	Return result of command.
OP_SPEECH	Local user speech (In same room.)  Doesn't block movement, etc.

OP_NORMAL	Normal output options (OP_AREA|OP_BROADCAST|OP_CHANNEL|OP_COMMAND|OP_ERROR|OP_PROMPT|OP_REMOTE|OP_SPEECH)
OP_BUILDING	Building output options (OP_COMMAND|OP_ERROR|OP_LOCAL|OP_PROMPT|OP_SPEECH)
OP_TRACE	Tracing output options (OP_ERROR|OP_EXEC|OP_EXPAND|OP_RESULT)


@output on|off

Turn output on/off.

@output default [= [!]<TYPE> [[!]<TYPE>] [...]]

Set or reset default output types, used when you connect.
'@output default' shows your current default output types.

@output type [= [!]<TYPE> [[!]<TYPE>] [...]]

Outside of a compound command, sets your current output types, which will
remain in effect until you disconnect.  '@output type' shows your current
output types.

Within a compound command, sets the output types used by @echo, @oecho, @write
and @notify.  This allows soft-coded commands to set the correct output type,
so that it doesn't get unwantedly filtered out.


Uses:
~~~~~
User could have two connections, one with normal output options, and the other
with BUILDING output options.  Output always goes to your current active
connection (I.e:  The one used most recently.)  This stops you receiving
pages, tells, @notify's, etc. on the connection used for building.


Changes
~~~~~~~
output() to allow originator and output type(s) to be specified.

getdsc() to allow output type(s) to be specified, so that the most recently
         used connection which is NOT blocking those output types can be
         found.

Replace LISTEN flag with CONNECTION output type.

Replace TRACING flag with TRACE output type.

IGNORE friend flag to implement support of ORIGINATOR in output() - Only
       looked up in friends list if ORIGINATOR != NOTHING.

Page/Tell, etc. need to be changed to stop you from sending a message to a
   user who you have set IGNORE.

Every use of output() and getdsc() needs changing to support above (A lot of
work!)
