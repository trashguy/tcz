struct array {
       u_char *field;	Pointer to first field
       u_char fields;   Number of fields (+2 (For index & first field) and *4
                        gives size of each field.
       long   size;     Current uncompressed size of array in bytes (This
                        determines the Building Quota used (Mem used by
                        struct for each element is also taken into account.)
}

Structure of each field is a block of u_char of appropriate size, divided into
segments of 4, for the 32-bit pointers:

[ NEXT | INDEX | FIELD 1 | FIELD 2 | ... ]


Completely empty array costs 1q.  Extra 1q charged per extra 1024 bytes in use
by the array.


New commands:

USAGE:  @field insert <ARRAY>[.<FIELD>] [= <NAME>]
        @field set <ARRAY>[.<FIELD>] [= <NAME>]
        @field delete <ARRAY> = <NUMBER>
        @field add <ARRAY> [= <NAME>]

This command is used to add, delete or modify the fields of a dynamic array.
By default, a dynamic array has no fields, and only has a description and
optional index name for each element.  Upto a maximum of 256 fields can be
created, giving each element multiple independent fields (Doing this will
effectively make the dynamic array two-dimensional.)

One example use of fields on the elements of a dynamic array would be the
creation of an address book.  For example, you want to be able to hold the
TCZ name, real life name and E-mail address of some of your friends.  For
this you could create a dynamic array, and then create the fields 'name',
'reallife' and 'email'.  This is done using the '@field add' command, e.g:

@array friends
@field add friends = name
@field add friends = reallife
@field add friends = email

Once a dynamic array has fields, you can refer to them by name or number, using
'<ARRAY>[<ELEMENT>].<FIELD>', where <ARRAY> is the name or #ID number of the
dynamic array, <ELEMENT> is the element number, range or index name and <FIELD>
is the name or number of the <FIELD>, e.g:  'friends[1].email'.  You could now
add your friends to the above dynamic array:

@desc friends[1].name = Mr X
@desc friends[1].realname = Fred Bloggs
@desc friends[1].email = fred@wibble.com

Describe each command individually for adding, deleting, etc. fields - Also,
explain how to list the fields available on the array (Using 'examine'.)
